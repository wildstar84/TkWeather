.SH NAME
geolocatezip.pl
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&./geolocatezip.pl, by (c) Jim Turner
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
geolocatezip.pl attempts to first fetch the users current IP address, then uses that 
to fetch the zipcode for that IP address using geolocation.  Failing that, it attempts 
to fetch the city and state for the IP address and then uses a postal service site 
to attempt to look up a zip-code for that city and state.  If multiple zip-codes are 
returned, then the last one is returned.  The zip-code found is written to STDOUT.
.PP
The purpose of this program is for use by TkWeather in order to get the weather 
hopefully for the location the user's computer is actually in.  This is useful if 
the user is a frequent traveler and using a laptop.
.PP
NOTE:  works for U.S., maybe Canada too; for now.
