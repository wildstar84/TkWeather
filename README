NAME
            TkWeather, by (c) Jim Turner

SYNOPSIS
            tkweather.pl [-options=values] [zip-code|"lookup"]

DESCRIPTION
            This program fetches the current weather conditions every 12 
            minutes (720 seconds) (configurable) from 
            https://forecast.weather.gov and displays a nice square iconic button 
            showing the current weather condition.  Clicking the button shows the 
            current basic weather condition values, such as temperature, humidity, 
            and wind.  Clicking again shows additional information, namely the 
            barometric pressure, visiblility, and "heat index" or 
            "wind chill" or "misery index".  
            Holding the [Shift] key while 
            clicking displays a webpage showing the detailed weather info. 
            Double-clicking or holding the [Alt] key while clicking refreshes the 
            data. 
            Holding the [Shift] and [Ctrl] keys simultainously while clicking 
            exits the program.
        
            For anyone not from Houston, Texas,
            the old "misery index" is the temperature plus dewpoint.  Anything 
            over 150 is considered "miserable"!  I use this for planning 
            workouts.  The default is to use the more modern "heat index".  
            Specify "index=misery" for the old Houston "misery index".  
            "wind chill" is used if the temperature is below 70 and wind 
            is >= 10mph regardless.  This has now been updated to a more 
            temperature-friendly value (>=100 is "miserable") by multiplying 
            the old value by 2/3 (0.6667).

CONFIGURATION
            How to set up:

            1)  Create a "tkweather" directory in your home directory.

            2)  You will also need to specify your zipcode either as the 
            command-line argument or add a "zipcode=yourzip" line in 
            $HOME/tkweather/tkweather.cfg
            Otherwise you get the weather at the author's zipcode!
            If you specify a string, such as "lookup" instead of a number, 
            tkweather will attempt to look up your zip-code using geolocatezipp.pl.

            3)  The optional file:  $HOME/tkweather/tkweather.cfg takes the
            format (defaults shown below):  Any line starting with "#" is 
            ignored as a comment (Default values are shown).

            4)  Copy the image "tkweather.gif" to $HOME/tkweather/

            5)  Copy tkweather.pl to somewhere in your PATH or wherever you 
            want to be able to run it from.  Make sure line 1 points to your
            perl interpreter.

            6)  To make this app appear in your AfterStep/Windowmaker "wharf", 
            add the following to your config file:
            *Wharf TkWeather "-" MaxSwallow "TkWeather" /usr/bin/nice -n 15 /usr/local/bin/tkweather.pl &
        
            7)  Enjoy!
