v1.05:	Eliminated "Geo::Weather" module requirement - www.w3.weather.com 
changed their HTML *AGAIN* and Geo::Weather is apparently keeping up, so I 
now scrape their page myself.
Added "browser" and "weatherurl" options, see manpage.

v1.06: Not released.

v1.07: Added ability to fetch weather from wunderground.
v1.09: Fixed install issues
v1.31: Added www.noaa.gov as a 3rd datasource choice.  Added metric option.
       Added warning / alert color to background.
v1.33: Fix for slight changes in Wunderground site (icon, wind, and visibility).
v1.34: -not released-
v1.35: Fix for slight changes in Wunderground & NOAA sites.
v1.37: Fix to accomodate alternate url in NOAA for the icon image.
v1.8:  Add fourth weather site option (Weatherbug).
v1.83: Create Windows version, Windows self-extracting setup and unify 
       with Linux version.
v1.84: Minor font change, fix Windows installer bug.
v1.87: Minor changes to accomodate weather site changes.
v2.1:  Added geolocation option for automatically fetching the weather for 
       for the zip-code in/near your ISP.
v2.21: Fixed weathersite changes
v2.22: Fixed wunderground icon url chg.
v2.32: Fix for massive changes to weatherbug's site - also added check so that 
       if lwp.simple.get fails to fetch site, we now try wget.  This needed for 
       weatherbug's "mobile" (alternate) site.  Also made slight tweaks to the 
       "misery index" calculation to factor both rel. humidity & dewpoint.
v2.33: Workaround for foobarred lwp-request (on my box) that now refuses to 
	  download images anymore by failing over to "wget".  Also tweaks for 
	  weather.com site changes. 
v2.60: Removed weatherbug from the choices of sites - they've become too spammed 
       up and it is no longer possible to scrape off the needed information.
v2.61: Removed weather.com from choices - too javascripted up, data no longer scrapeable - grrrrrr!
v2.71: Maintenance release to fix up changes in the sites.
       Added a "hot warning color" (hwarningcolor).
       Fixed issue w/geolocatezip.pl due to changes in the USPS website.
v2.72: Fix out-of-bounds weather-site array index.
v2.73: Reset image to default "smiling sun" image if TkWeather becomes unable 
       to pull (update) from any site.  Also, don't recalculate warning 
       background colors if no valid data was pulled.
v2.8:  Redesign regices for Wunderground site (they changed it up a bunch).
       Update license & copyright notice.
------- LONG DORMANT PERIOD -------
v3.4:  * NOAA is now the only weather site supported, as during the intrim, 
       Weather.com, Wunderground and Weatherbug (all commercial sites) have 
       all completely ofuscated their sites to where it's no longer possible to 
       scrape both an icon and the pertinent weather info text.
       * Numerous other updates, fixes & tweaks made internally.
       * "Misery Index" uses an improved formula & is scaled to 100 instead of 
       150 to look/feel more like a real feirenheight temperature value.
       * geolocatezip.pl has not changed.
       * Also included my tkweather.cfg (zip-code changed for privacy) for a 
       working example.
v3.41: * Fix failure to fully flash-cycle through the displays back to the 
       current one when in weather-alert status.
       * Change default re-fetch time from 1 to 3 minutes after a failure to 
       retrieve html from the site.
